## WNMP：

## 1、Windows11(WSL)+Nginx+Mariadb(Mroonga)+PHP
## 2、(Linux)WebDav+Nginx+Mariadb(Mroonga)+PHP

## Core Objectives of WNMP
WNMP is not merely about “packaging Nginx + PHP + MariaDB into a container.” Its purpose is to achieve host-level performance tuning and baseline security configuration (kernel network parameters, ulimit restrictions, SSH key setup, compilation optimizations, etc.) with a single click in a clean system environment.

## Why Docker is Not Suitable
These host-level capabilities are often uncontrollable within containers or require high privileges like --privileged, which undermines the fundamental purpose of container isolation.

## Recommended Deployment Methods
Therefore, WNMP is recommended for use on KVM virtual machines, cloud servers, or KVM virtual systems running within Proxmox (PVE) to fully leverage its performance tuning and system optimization advantages.

## 🚀 Overview

**WNMP** installs Nginx, PHP, and MariaDB with a single command, configures SSL via `acme.sh`, sets up WebDAV, applies BBR/FQ tuning, and safely disables THP.

It’s designed for **small to medium websites, edge nodes, and private deployments**, providing a stable and reproducible runtime environment.

---

## ✨ Core Features

- **Ready-to-Use Web Runtime**  
  Compiles latest Nginx (1.28.0) with `dav-ext`, `http2`, and `stream` modules.  
  Supports PHP 8.2–8.5 and MariaDB 10.6 / 10.11.

- **Kernel & Network Optimization**  
  Enables BBR/FQ, tunes `somaxconn` and file descriptors, disables THP.  
  Auto-writes to `/etc/sysctl.conf` and `/etc/security/limits.conf`.

- **Automatic SSL Certificates**  
  Integrates `acme.sh`.  
  Uses **Cloudflare DNS-01** first, falls back to **webroot**, then automatically reloads Nginx.

- **Multi-Site & WebDAV**  
  One-click vhost creation, built-in phpMyAdmin protection, and WebDAV account management.  
  Each domain uses an independent password file under `/home/passwd/`.

- **Maintainable Directory Layout**
  ```
  /usr/local/nginx
  /usr/local/php
  /home/wwwroot
  ```

- **Security by Default**
  - Hidden & sensitive file types disabled  
  - Reasonable timeouts/caching  
  - Unused PHP options turned off

Does it support one-click generation of SSH login keys?
Yes. Run bash wnmp.sh sshkey

=====================================================================

⚠️ Important reminder: Before confirming you have saved the private key to your own computer

⚠️ Do not disconnect the current SSH session, or you will be unable to log back into the server!

=====================================================================

Save the private key to your local computer. You can then load the key in an SSH client for password-less login.

After configuring key-based login, the server will block all username/password logins.

## How to Install and Use WMMP on Windows?

Ensure you are using Windows 11. First, install the WSL subsystem.

Press Win+R to open the Run dialog, type `cmd`. Press Shift+Ctrl+Enter to open the Administrator Command Prompt.

`wsl -l -o` # to check if remote system lists are accessible. If successful, WSL is functioning properly.

`wsl --install debian` # (Begin installing the Debian 13 subsystem. The first command execution may require a system restart or prompt for missing CPU virtualization support. Follow the on-screen instructions.)

After successful installation, you will be prompted to configure a standard account and password. Once configured, simply type: exit to exit the subsystem.

`wsl -d debian -u root` # Log into the Debian system as root

```bash
cd ~
apt update && apt install -y curl && curl -fL https://wnmp.org/wnmp.sh -o wnmp.sh && chmod +x wnmp.sh && bash wnmp.sh wslinit
```

In the taskbar, navigate to and open:
C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
Replace [username] with your actual Windows login username

Create a new wsl.vbs file and add the following content:
```bash
Set ws = CreateObject(“Wscript.Shell”)
ws.run “wsl -d debian”, 0
```
After initialization completes, the subsystem will have the SSH server installed. Restart your computer as prompted, then you can log into your WSL Debian subsystem using an SSH client just like a regular server VPS.

Login address: 127.0.0.1 Port: 22

Additional WSL commands: In the Windows cmd environment (not the subsystem shell console):

`wsl -l -v` # View list of installed systems
`wsl --shutdown` # Stop the subsystem
`wsl --unregister debian` # Unregister the subsystem

To enable LAN access to the subsystem, navigate to the C:\Users\[username] directory. Replace [username] with your actual Windows login name.

Create a new .wslconfig file and add the following content:
```bash
[wsl2]
networkingMode=Mirrored
dnsTunneling=true
firewall=true
autoProxy=true
[experimental]
hostAddressLoopback=true
```
Run the following command in an administrator PowerShell window to configure Hyper-V firewall settings for inbound connections:

`Set-NetFirewallHyperVVMSetting -Name ‘{40E0AC32-46A5-438A-A0B2-2B479E8F2E90}’ -DefaultInboundAction Allow`

Restart your computer again. You can now log into the subsystem using the same LAN IP address as your local Windows system. Enter `ipconfig` in the cmd console to view your local LAN IP.
