# WNMP：

# 1、Windows11(WSL)+Nginx+Mariadb+PHP
# 2、(Linux)WebDav+Nginx+Mariadb+PHP

# Core Objectives of WNMP
WNMP is not merely about “packaging Nginx + PHP + MariaDB into a container.” Its purpose is to achieve host-level performance tuning and baseline security configuration (kernel network parameters, ulimit restrictions, SSH key setup, compilation optimizations, etc.) with a single click in a clean system environment.

# Why Docker is Not Suitable
These host-level capabilities are often uncontrollable within containers or require high privileges like --privileged, which undermines the fundamental purpose of container isolation.

# Recommended Deployment Methods
Therefore, WNMP is recommended for use on KVM virtual machines, cloud servers, or KVM virtual systems running within Proxmox (PVE) to fully leverage its performance tuning and system optimization advantages.

## 🚀 Overview

**WNMP** installs Nginx, PHP, and MariaDB with a single command, configures SSL via `acme.sh`, sets up WebDAV, applies BBR/FQ tuning, and safely disables THP.

It’s designed for **small to medium websites, edge nodes, and private deployments**, providing a stable and reproducible runtime environment.

---

## ✨ Core Features

- **Ready-to-Use Web Runtime**  
  Compiles latest Nginx (1.28.0) with `dav-ext`, `http2`, and `stream` modules.  
  Supports PHP 8.2–8.5 and MariaDB 10.6 / 10.11.

- **Kernel & Network Optimization**  
  Enables BBR/FQ, tunes `somaxconn` and file descriptors, disables THP.  
  Auto-writes to `/etc/sysctl.conf` and `/etc/security/limits.conf`.

- **Automatic SSL Certificates**  
  Integrates `acme.sh`.  
  Uses **Cloudflare DNS-01** first, falls back to **webroot**, then automatically reloads Nginx.

- **Multi-Site & WebDAV**  
  One-click vhost creation, built-in phpMyAdmin protection, and WebDAV account management.  
  Each domain uses an independent password file under `/home/passwd/`.

- **Maintainable Directory Layout**
  ```
  /usr/local/nginx
  /usr/local/php
  /home/wwwroot
  ```

- **Security by Default**
  - Hidden & sensitive file types disabled  
  - Reasonable timeouts/caching  
  - Unused PHP options turned off

Does it support one-click generation of SSH login keys?
Yes. Run bash wnmp.sh sshkey

=====================================================================

⚠️ Important reminder: Before confirming you have saved the private key to your own computer

⚠️ Do not disconnect the current SSH session, or you will be unable to log back into the server!

=====================================================================

Save the private key to your local computer. You can then load the key in an SSH client for password-less login.

After configuring key-based login, the server will block all username/password logins.
